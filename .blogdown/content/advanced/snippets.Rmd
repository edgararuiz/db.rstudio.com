RStudio connections can be extended through:

1. **Snippet Files** that provide support for new connections using R templates that enable users and system administrators to list and create new connections.
2. **Packages** that do one or more of the following: 
     + Implement the [Connections Contract](/contract) to manage and explore data in RStudio's Connections Pane and/or
     + Supply Snippet Files or a Shiny Application to extend RStudio's New Connection dialog.

## Snippet Files

A Connection Snippet File is an R code snippet with additional metadata which is intended to initialize a connection. This file can be as simple as:

```r
library(readr)
data <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

Once this file is saved under `/etc/rstudio/connections/` as `Motor Trend Cars.R`, RStudio will make this connection as available as:

<img src="resources/connections/basic-connection-selection.png" width="300" style="display: inline-block"/><img src="resources/connections/basic-connection-interface.png" width="300" style="display: inline-block"/>

The path is configurable through the `connections-path` environment variable and multiple connection files can be specified.

In order to parameterize this connection, one can create fields using using the `${Position:Label=Default}` syntax:

- **Position:** The row position starting at zero.
- **Label:** The label assigned to this field.
- **Default:** An optional default value.

For example, we can filter out this dataframe to produce the following connection interface:

```r
library(readr)
data <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
data[data$mpg == ${0:Miles per Gallon=21.4} | data$cyl == ${1:Cylinders=6}, ]
```

<img src="resources/connections/fields-connection-interface.png" width="300" style="display: inline-block;margin: 0 auto;"/>

In order to create a `;` separated list of values, one can use the syntax `${Position:Label=Default:Key}`. Semicolon-separated list are common in database connections and therefore, natively supported in snippet files, for instance:

```r
"${2:Letters=ABC:LettersKey}${3:Numbers=123:NumbersKey}"
```

<img src="resources/connections/keyvalue-connection-interface.png" width="300" style="display: inline-block;margin: 0 auto;"/>

There are a couple escape characters supported: `$colon$` to escape `:` and `$equal` to escape `=`.

## R Packages

### Package Structure

A package supporting connections defines the following components:

- **Connections File: ** A DCF file must be created under `inst/rstudio/connections.dcf` to enumerate each connection supported in the package.
- **Snippet Files:** Snippet files are stored under `inst/rstudio/connections/`.

As a quick start, the [Rstudio Connections Example](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-connections-example) GitHub repo contains a working example of this structure.

### Connections Contract

You can integrate with RStudio's Connection Pane to allow users to explore connections created with your R package by using the [Connections Contract](/contract).

### Snippet Files

Snippet Files are specified under the `/inst/rstudio/connections` and follow the same syntax mentioned in the "Snippet Files" section.

### Shiny Application

For advanced connection interfaces, a shiny application can be specified. See [sparklyr](https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/blob/master/R/connection_shinyapp.R) for a working application.
