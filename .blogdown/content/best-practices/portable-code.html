title: "Making scripts portable"

<p>When we share R scripts, RNotebooks or other kind of content with others, and want the code to also execute in their environment, then we need to take steps to make the code portable. There are two primary considerations when sharing content that contain database connections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ensuring the connection details for the development and deployment environments are in sync</li>
<li>Managing database credentials</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many different ways to meet these two requirements. The following
examples show common deployment strategies:</p>
<div id="managing-connections-during-deployment" class="section level1">
<h1>Managing Connections During Deployment</h1>
<div id="deploying-with-dsns" class="section level2">
<h2>Deploying with DSNs</h2>
<p>One way to manage ODBC connections is through Data Source Names. DSNs define the details for
a connection including the server IP address, the database name, and often
access credentials. DSNs are typically defined by an administrator, and are
accessible across the server. It also possible to have user-specific or
project-specific DSNs.</p>
<p>Deploying content that uses a DSN is easy. The R code would look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)
library(odbc)

con &lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &quot;My DSN Name&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><code>My DSN Name</code> would correspond to an entry in an odbc.ini file. For example, the
DSN name “PostgresSQL2” would be used to reference the corresponding entry in
this hypothetical odic.ini file:</p>
<pre class="ini"><code>[PostgreSQL2]
Driver = /etc/lib/driver/libpsql.so
Database = mydb.company.com
Port = 5432
UID = service
PWD = serviceAcc0unt

[SalesWarehouse]
Driver = /etc/lib/drivers/oraclesqlib.so
...</code></pre>
<p>The key is to ensure that the DSN in the development environment and the DSN in the
deployment environment refer to the same database. It is possible that the two
DSNs will use different credentials or even different drivers, but the queries
submitted to the connection should work in both environments.</p>
<p>Be careful: it is easy for DSNs to differ between the development and deployment
environment. In some cases, the differences will lead to an error. For example,
if the DSN used locally does not exist on the server, the deployment will likely
fail. In other cases, it is possible that the DSNs will be similar enough for
deployment to succeed, but different enough for other parts of the code to fail.</p>
<p>When in doubt, be sure to ask your administrator to compare the odbc.ini and
odbcinst.ini files used locally and on the deployed server.</p>
</div>
<div id="deploying-with-the-config-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Deploying with the <code>config</code> Package</h2>
<p>An alternative to relying on DSNs is to use the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/config">config</a> package. The <code>config</code>
package allows the connection code in R to reference an external file that
defines values based on the environment. This process makes it easy to specify
values to use for a connection locally and values to use after deployment.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>R code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(config)

dw &lt;- get(&quot;datawarehouse&quot;)

con &lt;- dbConnect(
   Driver = dw$driver,
   Server = dw$server,
   UID    = dw$uid,
   PWD    = dw$pwd,
   Port   = dw$port,
   Database = dw$database
)</code></pre>
<p>config.yml:</p>
<pre class="ini"><code>default:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: &#39;Postgres&#39; 
    server: &#39;mydb-test.company.com&#39;
    uid: &#39;local-account&#39;
    pwd: &#39;my-password&#39;  // not recommended, see alternatives below
    port: 5432
    database: &#39;regional-sales-sample&#39;
    
rsconnect:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: &#39;PostgresPro&#39;
    server: &#39;mydb-prod.company.com&#39;
    uid: &#39;service-account&#39;
    pwd: &#39;service-password&#39; // not recommended, see alternatives below
    port: 5432
    database: &#39;regional-sales-full&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>config</code> package determines the active configuration by looking at the
<code>R_CONFIG_ACTIVE</code> environment variable. By default, RStudio Connect sets
<code>R_CONFIG_ACTIVE</code> to the value <code>rsconnect</code>. In the config file above, the
default datawarehouse values would be used locally and the datawarehouse values
defined in the <code>rsconnect</code> section would be used on RStudio Connect.
Administrators can optionally customize the name of the active configuration
used in Connect.</p>
</div>
<div id="deploying-with-the-config-package-and-credentials" class="section level2">
<h2>Deploying with the <code>config</code> Package and Credentials</h2>
<p>In the previous example, the credentials used locally and after deployment were
stored in plain text in the configuration file. There are many ways to avoid
plain text storage. It is common for the method used to access credentials
locally to vary from the method used for deployed content. For example, the
following config uses keyring to access credentials locally, but accesses an
environment variable on the deployed server.</p>
<p>config.yml:</p>
<pre class="ini"><code>default:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: &#39;Postgres&#39; 
    server: &#39;mydb-test.company.com&#39;
    uid: !expr keyring::key_get(&quot;db-credentials&quot;)[1,2]&#39;
    pwd: !expr keyring::key_get(&quot;db-credentials&quot;)[1,2]&#39;
    port: 5432
    database: &#39;regional-sales-sample&#39;
    
rsconnect:
  datawarehouse:
    driver: &#39;PostgresPro&#39;
    server: &#39;mydb-prod.company.com&#39;
    uid: !expr Sys.getenv(&quot;DBUSER&quot;)
    pwd: !expr Sys.getenv(&quot;DBPWD&quot;)
    port: 5432
    database: &#39;regional-sales-full&#39;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="deploying-with-different-dsns" class="section level2">
<h2>Deploying with Different DSNs</h2>
<p>The <code>config</code> package provides a very flexible way to specify connections. It is
even possible to use the <code>config</code> package with DSNs! For example, if the local DSN
entry was named “DatawarehouseTest” and the DSN on the production server was
named “DatawarehouseProd”:</p>
<p>R code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(config)

dsn &lt;- get(&quot;datawarehouse&quot;)

con &lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), dsn)
</code></pre>
<p>config.yml</p>
<pre class="ini"><code>default:
  datawarehouse: &#39;DatawarehouseTest&#39;

rsconnect:
  datawarehouse: &#39;DatawarehouseProd&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In all cases, it is important that the R code (whether a R Markdown document or
a Shiny application) be able to run successfully in both the development and
deployment environment without changes. It is not possible to change hard-coded
values prior to deployment.</p>
