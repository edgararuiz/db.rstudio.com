<h2><strong>dplyr</strong> as a database interface</h2>
<p>The <code>dplyr</code> package simplifies data transformation. It provides a consistent set of functions, called verbs, that can be used in succession and interchangeably to gain understanding of the data iteratively.</p>
<p><code>dplyr</code> is able to <strong>interact with databases directly</strong> by translating the <code>dplyr</code> verbs into SQL queries. This convenient feature allows you to ‘speak’ directly with the database from R. Other advantages of this approach are:</p>

<li><p><strong>Run data exploration routines over all of the data</strong>, instead of importing part of the data into R.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use the SQL Engine to run the data transformations.</strong> In effect, computation is being pushed to the database.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collect into R only a targeted dataset.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>All of your code is in R.</strong> Because<code>dplyr</code> is used to communicate with the database, there is no need to alternate between languages or tools to perform the data exploration.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Connect to a database</strong></h2>

<p><strong>At the center of this approach is the <code>DBI</code> package.</strong> This package acts as <em>‘middle-ware’</em> between packages to allow connectivity with the database from the user or other packages. It provides a consistent set of functions regardless of the database type being accessed. The <code>dplyr</code> package depends on the <code>DBI</code> package for communication with databases.</p>
<p>There are packages that enables a direct connection between the an open-source database and R. Currently, such packages exist for the following databases: <em>MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and bigquery</em>.</p>

<p>Most commercial databases, like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server, offer ODBC drivers that allow you to connect your tool to the database. Even though there are R packages that allow you to use ODBC drivers, the connection will most likely not be compatible with <code>DBI</code>. The new <code>odbc</code> package solves that problem by providing a <code>DBI</code> backend to any ODBC driver connection.</p>
<p>If you are interested in creating your own package that connects <code>DBI</code> to a database, please review the article <a href="backend">DBI Backend</a>.</p>

<div id="sql-translations-for-dplyr" class="section level2">
<h2>SQL Translations for <code>dplyr</code></h2>
<p>A complementary package called <code>dbplyr</code> contains the translations of the vendor-specific SQL for <code>dplyr</code> to use. A list of known supported databases are available in our <a href="/databases">Databases</a> page.</p>
<p>Is the database you are interested in not listed here? You can still use <code>DBI</code> and <code>odbc</code> to connect and send SQL queries. If you would like to contribute a translation, please see the <a href="translation">SQL Translation</a> page in this website.</p>
