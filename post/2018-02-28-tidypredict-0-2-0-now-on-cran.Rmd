summary:  "We are excited to announce that tidypredict version 0.2.0 is now on CRAN.  This version adds support for ranger() models.  tidypredict parses a fitted R model object, and returns a formula in ‘Tidy Eval’ code that calculates the predictions."

Run predictions inside the database. `tidypredict` parses a fitted R model object, and returns a formula in 'Tidy Eval' code that calculates the predictions.

**It works with several databases back-ends** because it leverages `dplyr` and `dbplyr` for the final SQL translation of the algorithm. It currently supports `lm()`, `glm()`, `randomForest()` and `ranger()` models.
