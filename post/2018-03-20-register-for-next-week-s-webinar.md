Get the most out of joining R forces with database forces.  We will review key concepts, share the latest in R packages, and demo useful techniques. In this webinar, we will demonstrate a pragmatic approach for pairing R with databases. You will learn to use Râ€™s familiar dplyr syntax to perform queries. We will also share the latest in R packages that aid with visualization and running predictions in-database. The webinar will focus on general principles and best practices; we will avoid technical details related to specific data store implementations.
